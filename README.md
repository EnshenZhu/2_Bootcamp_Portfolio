* WHEN I load their portfolio, THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation, THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work, THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application, THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* WHEN I click on the images of the applications, THEN I am taken to that deployed application

* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## <li>About Content
<p>
    By far, this webpage is functioned as a demo for the advanced CSS display. As this webpage is still in the working progress, most of the contents have very limited length. Meanwhile, because of insufficient projects I have ever made, despite having different image styles, the links behind the four images in the 'Working Example' section are linked to one single project I made before.
